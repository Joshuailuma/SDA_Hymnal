'''152  Tell Me the Story of Jesus+
1\n
Tell me the story of Jesus,
Write on my heart every word,
Tell me the story most precious
Sweetest that ever was heard;
Tell how the angels, in chorus,
Sang as they welcomed His birth,
Glory to God in the highest,
Peace and good tidings to earth.~
Refrain\n
Tell me the story of Jesus,
Write on my heart every word,
Tell me the story most precious,
Sweetest that ever was heard.~
2\n
Fasting, alone in the desert,
Tell of the days that He passed,
How for our sins He was tempted,
Yet was triumphant at last;
Tell of the years of His labor,
Tell of the sorrow He bore,
He was despised and afflicted,
Homeless, rejected, and poor.~
3\n
Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,
Writhing in anguish and pain;
Tell of the grave where they laid Him,
Tell how He liveth again;
Love in that story so tender,
Clearer than ever I see;
Stay, let me weep while you whisper,
Love paid the ransom for me.''', 
'''154  When I Survey the Wondrous Cross+
1\n
When I survey the wondrous cross
on which the Prince of Glory died;
my richest gain I count but loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.~
2\n
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
save in the death of Christ, my God;
all the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to his blood.~
3\n
See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
sorrow and love flow mingled down.
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
or thorns compose so rich a crown.~
4\n
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
that were an offering far too small;
love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all.''',

'''156  O Sacred Head Now Wounded +
1\n
O sacred Head, now wounded,
with grief and shame weighed down,
now scornfully surounded
with thorns, thine only crown:
how pale thou art with anguish,
with sore abuse and scorn!
How does that visage languish
which once was bright as morn!~
2\n
What thou, my Lord, has suffered
was all for sinners' gain;
mine, mine was the transgression,
but thine the deadly pain.
Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
'Tis I deserve thy place;
look on me with thy favor,
vouchsafe to me thy grace.~
3\n
What language shall I borrow
to thank thee, dearest friend,
for this thy dying sorrow,
thy pity without end?
O make me thine forever;
and should I fainting be,
Lord, let me never, never 
outlive my love for thee.''',
'''157  Go to Dark Gethsemane+
1\n
Go to dark Gethsemane,
ye that feel the tempter's power;
your Redeemer's conflict see,
watch with him one bitter hour.
Turn not from his griefs away;
learn of Jesus Christ to pray.~
2\n
See him at the judgment hall,
beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;
O the wormwood and the gall!
O the pangs his soul sustained!
Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;
learn of Christ to bear the cross.~
3\n
Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
there, adoring at his feet,
mark that miracle of time,
God's own sacrifice complete. 
"It is finished!" hear him cry;
learn of Jesus Christ to die.''',

'''159  The Old Rugged Cross+
1\n
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
the emblem of suffering and shame;
and I love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain.~
Refrain\n
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.~
2\n
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
has a wondrous attraction for me;
for the dear Lamb of God left his glory above
to bear it to dark Calvary.~
3\n
To that old rugged cross I will ever be true,
its shame and reproach gladly bear;
then he'll call me some day to my home far away,
where his glory forever I'll share.''',

'''163  At the Cross+
1\n
Alas! and did my Savior bleed,
and did my Sovereign die?
Would he devote that sacred head
for sinners such as I?~
Refrain\n
At the cross, at the cross,
where I first saw the light,
and the burden of my heart rolled away;
it was there by faith I received my sight,
and now I am happy all the day!~
2\n
Was it for crimes that I have done,
he groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!~
3\n
But drops of grief can ne'er repay
the debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away;
'tis all that I can do!''' ,

1\n

Where Thy body lay.~

Risen, conquering Son;
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won.~

Through Thy deathless love;

To Thy home above.''',

'''181  Does Jesus Care?+
1\n
Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
Too deeply for mirth and song;
As the burdens press, and the cares distress,
And the way grows weary and long?~
Refrain\n
O yes, He cares- I know He cares!
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary,
The long nights dreary,
I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)~

Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades into deep night shades, 
Does He care enough to be near?~

To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks -
Is it aught to Him? Does He see?''',

No longer bound
To distant years in Palestine,
He comes to claim the here and now
And conquer every place and time.~

In every insult,
rift, and war
Where color, scorn or wealth divide,
He suffers still, yet loves the more, 
And lives, though ever crucified.~

Ascended Lord
He rules the world His Father made,
Till, in the end, His love adored
Shall be to all on earth displayed.''',

Endless praise my heart shall give;
He has died that I might live
I will sing His love to me.~
2\n
O the depths of love divine!
Earth or heaven can never know
How that sin as dark as mine
can be made as white as snow. ~

Nothing good for Him I've done;
How could He such love bestow?
Lord, I own my heart is won,
help me now my love to show.''',

'''184  Jesus Paid It All+

I hear the Savior say,
"Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."~

Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain;
He washed it white as snow.~
2\n
Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots,
And melt the heart of stone.~

Since nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim,
I'll wash my garment white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb.~

I stand in Him complete,
I'll lay my trophies down,
All down at Jesus' feet.''',

Those ties which nought can sever,
For I am His, and He is mine,
Forever and forever.~

So kind, and true, and tender,
So wise a counselor and guide,
