223  Crown Him With Many Crowns+
1\n
Crown him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon his throne,
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns 
all music but its own.
Awake, my soul, and sing
of him who died for thee,
and hail him as thy matchless King
through all eternity.
2\n
Crown him the Lord of love!
behold his hands and side,
those wounds, yet visible above,
in beauty glorified;
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bend his wondering eye
At mysteries so great.
3\n
Crown him the Lord of peace!
whose power a scepter sways
from pole to pole, that wars may cease,
and all be prayer and praise.
His reign shall know no end,
and round his pierced feet
fair flowers of paradise extend
their fragrance ever sweet.
4\n
Crown him the Lord of years;
The potentate of time, 
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime!
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For thou hast died for me;
thy praise shall never, never fail
throughout eternity.
228  A Hymn of Glory Let Us Sing+

Ascends unto the throne of God.

In heav'n to be our great reward.

To Him all majesty ascribe, and crown Him Lord of all.

230  All Glory, Laud, and Honor+
1\n
All glory, laud, and honor,
to thee, Redeemer, King,
to whom the lips of children 
made sweet hosannas ring.
Thou art the King of Israel,
thou David's royal Son,
who in the Lord's name comest,
the King and Blessed One.
2\n
The company of angels
are praising thee on high,
and we with all creation
in chorus make reply.
The people of the Hebrews
with psalms before thee went;
our prayer and praise and anthems
before thee we present.
3\n
To thee, before thy passion,
they sang their hymns of praise;
to thee, now high exalted,
our melody we raise.
Thou didst accept their praises;
accept the prayers we bring,
who in all good delightest,
thou good and gracious King. 
233  Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies+
1\n
Christ, whose glory fills the skies,
Christ, the true, the only light,
Sun of Righteousness, arise,
triumph o'er the shades of night;
Dayspring from on high, be near;
Daystar, in my heart appear.
2\n
Dark and cheerless is the morn
unaccompanied by thee;
joyless is the day's return,
till thy mercy's beams I see;
till they inward light impart,
cheer my eyes and warm my heart.
3\n
Visit then this soul of mine;
pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
fill me, Radiancy divine,
scatter all my unbelief;
more and more thyself display,
shining to the perfect day.
236  I Love Thee+
1\n
I love Thee, I love Thee,
I love Thee, my Lord;
I love Thee, my Savior,
I love Thee, my God.
I love Thee, I love Thee,
and that Thou dost know;
But how much I love Thee
my actions will show.
2\n
I'm happy, I'm happy,
O, wondrous account!
My joys are immortal,
I stand on the mount!
I gaze on my treasure
and long to be there,
With Jesus and angles,
and kindred so dear.
3\n
O Jesus, my Savior,
with Thee I am blest,
My life and salvation,
my joy and my rest:
Thy name by my theme,
and Thy love be my song;
Thy grace shall inspire both 
my heart and my tongue.
4\n
O, who's like my Savior?
He's Salem's bright King;
He smiles, and He loves me,
and helps me to sing.
I'll praise Him, I'll praise Him,
with notes loud and clear,
While rivers of pleasure
my spirit do cheer.
237  In the Cross of Christ I Glory+
1\n
In the cross of Christ I glory,
towering o'er the wrecks of time;
all the light of sacred story
gathers round its head sublime.
2\n
When the woes of life o'ertake me,
hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
never shall the cross forsake me. 
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.
3\n
When the sun of bliss is beaming
light and love upon my way,
from the cross the radiance streaming
adds more luster to the day.
4\n
Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
by the cross are sanctified;
peace is there that knows no measure,
joys that through all time abide.
239  Jesus, Priceless Treasure+
1\n
Jesus, priceless treasure,
source of purest pleasure,
truest friend to me,
long my heart hath panted,
till it well-nigh fainted,
thirsting after thee.
Thine I am, O spotless Lamb,
I will suffer naught to hide thee,
ask for naught beside thee.
2\n 
In thine arms I rest me;
foes who would molest me
cannot reach me here.
Though the earth be shaking,
every heart be quaking,
Jesus calms our fear;
sin and hell in conflict fell
with their heaviest storms assail us;
Jesus will not fail us.
3\n
Hence, all thoughts of sadness!
For the Lord of gladness,
Jesus, enters in.
Those who love the Father,
through the storms may gather,
still have peace within;
yea, whate'er we here must bear,
still in thee lies purest pleasure,
Jesus, priceless treasure!
240  Fairest Lord Jesus+
1\n
Fairest Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature,
O thou of God and man the Son!
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor, 
thou, my soul's glory, joy, and crown.
2\n
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,
robed in the blooming garb of spring:
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer
who makes the woeful heart to sing.
3\n
Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight,
and all the twinkling starry host:
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
than all the angels heaven can boast.
4\n
Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations,
Son of God and Son of Man!
Glory and honor, praise, adoration,
now and forevermore be thine!
241  Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee+
1\n
Jesus, the very thought of thee
with sweetness fills the breast;
but sweeter far thy face to see,
and in thy presence rest. 
2\n
No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,
The Savior of mankind.
3\n
O hope of every contrite heart!
O joy of all the meek,
to those who fall, how kind thou art!
How good to those who seek!
4\n
But what to those who find? Ah, this
nor tongue nor pen can show;
the love of Jesus, what it is,
none but his loved ones know.
5\n
Jesus, our only joy be thou,
as thou our prize wilt be;
Jesus, be thou our glory now,
and through eternity.

Showing the things of Christ to me.

Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

Riches in glory all His own;

More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

that bids our sorrows cease;

new life the dead receive;

And just the time I need Him He's always near.

He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today! 
He walks with me and talks with me
along life's narrow way.
He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!
You ask me how I know He lives?
He lives within my heart.

In all the world around me I see His loving care,
And tho' my heart grows weary
I never will despair;
I know that He is leading thru all the stormy blast,
The day of His appearing will come at last.

Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King!
The hope of all who seek Him,
the help of all who find,
None other is so loving, so good and kind.

all honor and blessing with angels above,
and thanks never ceasing and infinite love. 
257  Come Down, O Love Divine+
1\n
Come down, O Love divine,
seek thou this soul of mine,
and visit it with thine own ardor glowing;
O Comforter, draw near,
within my heart appear,
and kindle it, thy holy flame bestowing.
2\n
O let it freely burn,
till earthly passions turn
to dust and ashes in its heat consuming;
and let thy glorious light
shine ever on my sight,
and clothe me round, the while my path illuming.
3\n
Let holy charity
Mine outward vesture be,
and lowliness become my inner clothing;
True lowliness of heart
Which takes the humbler part,
And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.
4\n
And so the yearning strong, 
with which the soul will long,
shall far outpass the power of human telling;
for none can guess its grace,
till Love create a place
wherein the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling.
266  Spirit of God+
1\n
Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;
wean it from earth; through all its pulses move;
stoop to my weakness, mighty as thou art,
and make me love thee as I ought to love.
2\n
I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies,
no sudden rending of the veil of clay,
no angel visitant, no opening skies;
but take the dimness of my soul away.
3\n
Has thou not bid me love thee, God and King?
All, all thine own, soul, heart and strength and mind.
I see thy cross; there teach my heart to cling.
O let me seek thee, and O let me find.
4\n 
Teach me to feel that thou art always nigh;
teach me the struggles of the soul to bear.
To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh,
teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.
5\n
Teach me to love thee as thine angels love,
one holy passion filling all my frame;
the kindling of the heaven-descended Dove,
my heart an altar, and thy love the flame.
268  Holy Spirit, Light Divine+
1\n
Holy Spirit, light divine,
Shine upon this heart of mine,
Chase the shades of night away,
Turn my darkness into day.

Holy Spirit, power divine,
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
Long has sin, without control,
Held dominion o'er my soul. 
3\n
Holy Ghost, with joy divine,
Cheer this saddened heart of mine,
Bid my many woes depart,
Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.
4\n
Holy Spirit, all divine,
Dwell within this heart of mine,
Cast down every idol throne,
Reign supreme, and reign alone.
271  Break Thou the Bread of Life+
1\n
Break thou the bread of life, dear Lord, to me,
as thou didst break the loaves beside the sea;
beyond the sacred page I seek thee, Lord;
my spirit pants for thee, O Living Word!
2\n
Bless thou the truth, dear Lord, to me, to me,
as thou didst bless the bread by Galilee;
then shall all bondage cease, all fetters fall;
and I shall find my peace, my all in all.
3\n
Thou art the bread of life, O Lord, to me; 
Thy holy Word the truth That saveth me;
Give me to eat and live With Thee above;
Teach me to love Thy truth, For Thou art love.

I hasten to obey, But I am weak;
Thou art my only help, Thou art my life;
Heeding Thy holy Word I win the strife.
272  Give Me the Bible+

Give me the Bible, star of gladness gleaming,
To cheer the wanderer lone and tempest tossed,
No storm can hide that peaceful radiance beaming
Since Jesus came to seek and save the lost.
Refrain\n
Give me the Bible-holy message shining,
Thy light shall guide me in the narrow way.
Precept and promise, law and love combining,
'Til night shall vanish in eternal day.
2\n
Give me the Bible when my heart is broken,
When sin and grief have filled my soul with fear,
Give me the precious words by Jesus spoken, 
Hold up faith's lamp to show my Savior near.
3\n
Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten,
Teach me the danger of these realms below,
That lamp of safety, o'er the gloom shall brighten,
That light alone the path of peace can show.
274  O Word of God Incarnate+
1\n
O Word of God incarnate,
O Wisdom from on high,
O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
O Light of our dark sky:
we praise you for the radiance
that from the hallowed page,
a lantern to our footsteps,
shines on from age to age.
2\n
The church from her dear Master
received the gift divine,
and still that light is lifted
o'er all the earth to shine.
It is the sacred vessel
where gems of truth are stored;
it is the heaven-drawn picture 
of Christ, the living Word.
3\n
It floateth like a banner
before God's host unfurled;
it is a shining beacon
above the darkling world.
It is the chart and compass
that o'er life's surging tide,
mid mists and rocks and quicksands,
Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.
4\n
O make Thy church, dear Savior,
a lamp of purest gold,
to bear before the nations
your true light as of old.
O teach your wandering pilgrims
by this their path to trace,
till, clouds and darkness ended,
they see Thee face to face.

Weak and wounded, sick and sore;

I will arise and go to Jesus,
He will embrace me in His arms;
In the arms of my dear Savior,
O there are ten thousand charms.
2\n
Come. ye thirsty, come, and welcome,
God's free bounty glorify;
True belief and true repentance,
Every grace that brings you nigh.
3\n
Let not conscience make you linger,
Nor of fitness fondly dream;
All the fitness He requireth
Is to feel your need of Him.
4\n
Lo! th'incarnate God, ascended,
Pleads the merit of His blood;
Venture on Him, venture wholly,
Let no other trust intrude. 
281  I Gave My Life for Thee+
1\n
I gave my life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might'st ransom be,
And quickened from the dead;
I gave, I gave My life for thee,
What hast thou given for Me?
I gave, I gave My life for thee,
What hast thou given for Me?
2\n
My Fathers house of light,
My glory circled throne,
I left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone;
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for Me?
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for Me?
3\n
I suffered much for thee, 
more than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue thee from hell;
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for Me?
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for Me?
284  For You I Am Praying+
1\n

A dear, loving Savior, though earth
friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness
o'er me,
But oh that my Savior were your
Savior, too.

For you I am praying, For you I am
Praying,
For you am I praying, I'm praying for you.
2\n 
I have a Father; to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
And soon He will call to meet Him in
heaven,
But oh that He'd let me bring you
with me, too!
3\n
I have a robe; 'tis resplendent in
whiteness,
Awaiting in glory my wondering
view;
Oh, when I receive it, all shining in
brightness,
Dear friend, could I see you receiv-
ing one, too!
4\n
When Jesus has found you, tell others
the story,
That my loving Savior is your Sav-
ior, too;
Then pray that your Savior will bring
them to glory,
And prayer will be answered-'twas
answered for you! 
285  Jesus Calls Us+
1\n
Jesus calls us o'er the tumult
of our life's wild, restless sea;
day by day his sweet voice soundeth,
saying, "Christian, follow me!"
2\n
Jesus calls us from the worship
of the vain world's golden store,
from each idol that would keep us,
saying, "Christian, love me more!"

In our joys and in our sorrows,
days of toil and hours of ease,
still he calls, in cares and pleasures,
"Christian, love me more than these!"

Come home, come home;
ye who are weary come home;
earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
calling, O sinner, come home!
2\n
Why should we tary when Jesus is pleading,
pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,
mercies for you and for me?

promised for you and for me!
Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon,
pardon for you and for me.

In the precious
blood of the Lamb.

Would you do service
for Jesus your King?
There's pow'r in the blood,
pow'r in the blood;
Would you live daily
His praises to sing?
There's wonderful
power in the blood.
295  Chief of Sinners+
1\n
Chief of sinners though I be,
Jesus shed His blood for me;
Died that I might live on high, 
Died that I might never die;
As the brance is to the vine,
I am His, and He is mine.
2\n
O the height of Jesus' love!
Higher than the heaven above,
Deeper than the deepest sea,
Lasting as eternity;
Love that found me-wondrous thought!
Found me when I sought Him not!
3\n
Chief of sinners though I be,
Christ is all in all to me;
All my wants to Him are known,
All my sorrows are His own;
Safe with Him from earthly strife,
He sustains the hidden life.
296  Lord, I'm Comming Home+

Coming home, coming home
Never more to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord I'm coming home.

Now I'm coming home;

Now I'm coming home;
I'll trust thy love belive thy word;
Lord I'm coming home.

Now I'm coming home;
That Jesus died, and died for me;
Lord I'm coming home.

I need His cleansing blood I know,
Now I'm coming home;
O wash me whiter than the snow;
Lord I'm coming home. 
300  Rock of Ages+
1\n
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
let me hide myself in Thee;
let the water and the blood,
from thy riven side which flowed,
be of sin the double cure;
cleanse me from its guilt and power.
2\n
Not the labors of my hands
can fulfill thy law's demands;
could my zeal no respite know,
could my tears forever flow,
all for sin could not atone;
thou must save, and thou alone.
3\n
When my pilgrimage I close,
Victor o'er the last of foes,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
and behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
let me hide myself in Thee. 
301  Near, Still Nearer+
1\n
Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,
Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;
Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,
Shelter me safe in that haven of rest,
Shelter me safe in that haven of rest.
2\n
Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
Nought as an offering to Jesus my King-
Only my sinful now contrite heart,
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.
3\n
Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine;
Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.
4\n
Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last;
Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
Through endless ages, ever to be, 
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee.
303  Beneath the Cross of Jesus+
1\n
Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
the shadow of a mighty rock
within a weary land;
a home within the wilderness,
a rest upon the way,
from the burning of the noontide heat,
and the burden of the day.
2\n
Upon that cross of Jesus
mine eye at times can see
the very dying form of One
who suffered there for me;
and from my stricken heart with tears
two wonders I confess:
the wonders of redeeming love
and my unworthiness.
3\n
I take, O cross, thy shadow
for my abiding place; 
I ask no other sunshine than
the sunshine of his face;
content to let the world go by,
to know no gain nor loss,
my sinful self my only shame,
my glory all the cross.
306  Draw Me Nearer+
1\n
I am thine, O Lord, I have heard thy voice,
and it told thy love to me;
but I long to rise in the arms of faith
and be closer drawn to thee.
Refrain\n
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
to the cross where thou hast died.
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
to thy precious, bleeding side.
2\n
Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord,
by the power of grace divine;
let my soul look up with a steadfast hope, 
and my will be lost in thine.
3\n
O the pure delight of a single hour
that before thy throne I spend,
when I kneel in prayer, and with thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!
309  I Surrender All+
1\n
All to Jesus I surrender;
all to him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust him,
in his presence daily live.
Refrain\n
I surrender all, I surrender all,
all to thee, my blessed Savior,
I surrender all.
2\n
All to Jesus I surrender;
humbly at his feet I bow,
worldly pleasures all forsaken;
take me, Jesus, take me now.
3\n 
All to Jesus I surrender;
make me, Savior, wholly thine;
fill me with thy love and power;
truly know that thou art mine.
4\n
All to Jesus I surrender;
now I feel the sacred flame.
O the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory, to his name!
312  Near the Cross+
1\n
Jesus, keep me near the cross;
there a precious fountain,
free to all, a healing stream,
flows from Calvary's mountain.
Refrain\n
In the cross, in the cross,
be my glory ever,
till my raptured soul shall find
rest beyond the river. 
2\n
Near the cross, a trembling soul,
love and mercy found me;
there the bright and morning star
sheds its beams around me.
3\n
Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
bring its scenes before me;
help me walk from day to day
with its shadow o'er me.
4\n
Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
hoping, trusting ever,
till I reach the golden strand
just beyond the river.
314  Just as I Am+
1\n
Just as I am, without one plea,
but that thy blood was shed for me,
and that thou bidst me come to thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
2\n
Just as I am, and waiting not
to rid my soul of one dark blot,
to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
3\n
Just as I am, though tossed about
with many a conflict, many a doubt,
fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
4\n
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
sight, riches, healing of the mind,
yea, all I need in thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
5\n
Just as I am, thou wilt receive,
wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
because thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
6\n
Just as I am, thy love I own
hath broken every barrier down;
now, to be thine, and thine alone, 
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
318  Whiter Than Snow+
1\n
Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;
I want Thee forever to live in my soul;
Break down every idol, cast out every foe;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Refrain\n
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
2\n
Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,
And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
I give up myself, and whatever I know;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
3\n
Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;
I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet,
By faith, for my cleansing; I see Thy blood flow;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
4\n
Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;
Come now, and within me a new heart create;
To those who have sought Thee,
Thou never said'st No;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
321  My Jesus, I Love Thee+
1\n
My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine;
for thee all the follies of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou;
if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
2\n
I love thee because thou hast first loved me,
and purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow;
if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
3\n
I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee 'til death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow, 
if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
4\n
In mansions of glory and endless delight;
I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright;
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;
if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
326  Open My Eyes That I May See+
1\n
Open my eyes, that I may see
Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
Place in my hands the wonderful key
That shall unclasp and set me free.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes,
illumine me, Spirit Divine!
2\n
Open my ears that I may hear
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
and while the wavenotes fall on my ear,
Everything false will disappear.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my ears, illumine me, Spirit Divine! 
3\n
Open my mouth, and let me bear
Gladly the warm truth everywhere;
Open my heart, and let me prepare
Love with Thy children thus to share.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my heart, illumine me, Spirit Divine!
327  I'd Rather Have Jesus+
1\n
I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
I'd rather be His than have riches untold:
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand
Refrain\n
Than to be the king of a vast domain
Or be held in sin's dread sway.
I'd rather have Jesus tan anything
This world affords today.
2\n
I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause;
I rather be faithful to His dear cause;
Id rather have Jesus than worldwide fame. 
I'd rather be true to His holy name.
3\n
He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;
He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;
He's all than my hungering spirit needs.
I'd rather hav Jesus and let Him lead
328  Must Jesus Bear the Cross Alone+
1\n
Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
and all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for everyone,
and there's a cross for me.
2\n
The consecrated cross I'll bear
till He shall set me free;
and then go home my crown to wear,
for there's a crown for me.
3\n
Upon the crystal pavement, down
at Jesus' pierced feet,
with joy I'll cast my golden crown,
and His dear name repeat. 
329  Take the World, but Give Me Jesus+
1\n
Take the wold, but give me Jesus;
All its Joys are but a name,
But His love abideth ever,
Through eternal years the same.
Refrain\n
Oh, the height and depth of mercy!
Oh, the length and breadth of love!
Oh, the fullness of redemption,
Pledge of endless life above
2\n
Take the wold, but give me Jesus,
Sweetest comfort of my soul;
With my Savior watching o'er me,
I can sing, though billows roll.
3\n
Take the wold, but give me Jesus;
Let me view his constant smile;
Then throughout my pilgrim journey 
Light will cheer me all the while.
4\n
Take the wold, but give me Jesus;
In His cross my trust shall be,
Till, with clearer, brighter vision
Face to face my Lord I see.
331  O Jesus, I Have Promised+
1\n
O Jesus, I have promised
to serve thee to the end;
be thou forever near me,
my Master and my friend.
I shall not fear the battle
if thou art by my side,
nor wander from the pathway
if thou wilt be my guide.
2\n
O let me feel thee near me!
The world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
the tempting sounds I hear; 
my foes are ever near me,
around me and within;
but Jesus, draw thou nearer,
and shield my soul from sin.
3\n
O Jesus, thou hast promised
to all who follow thee
that where thou art in glory
there shall thy servant be.
And Jesus, I have promised
to serve thee to the end;
O give me grace to follow,
my Master and my Friend.
334  Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing+
1\n
Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it, 
mount of thy redeeming love.
2\n
Here I raise mine Ebenezer;
hither by thy help I'm come;
and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wandering from the fold of God;
he, to rescue me from danger,
interposed his precious blood.
3\n
O to grace how great a debtor
daily I'm constrained to be!
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
bind my wandering heart to thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love;
here's my heart, O take and seal it,
seal it for thy courts above.
336  There Is a Fountain+
1\n 
There is a fountain filled with blood
drawn from Emmanuel's veins;
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains.
Lose all their guilty stains,
lose all their guilty stains;
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains.
2\n
The dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day;
and there may I, though vile as he,
wash all my sins away.
Wash all my sins away,
wash all my sins away;
and there may I, though vile as he,
wash all my sins away.
3\n
Thou dying Lamb!, thy precious blood
shall never lose its power
till all the ransomed church of God
be saved, to sin no more.
Be saved, to sin no more,
be saved, to sin no more;
till all the ransomed church of God
be saved, to sin no more. 
4\n
E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
thy flowing wounds supply,
redeeming love has been my theme,
and shall be till I die.
And shall be till I die,
and shall be till I die;
redeeming love has been my theme,
and shall be till I die.
5\n
Lord, I believe Thow hast prepared,
Unworthy though I be,
For me a blood-bought, free reward
A golden harp for me!
A golden harp for me!
A golden harp for me!
For me a blood-bought, free reward
A golden harp for me!
6\n
There in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing thy power to save,
when this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Is ransomed form the grave,
Is ransomed form the grave,
Is ransomed form the grave,
when this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Is ransomed form the grave. 
341  To God Be the Glory+
1\n
To God be the glory, great things he hath done!
So loved he the world that he gave us his Son,
who yielded his life an atonement for sin,
and opened the lifegate that all may go in.
Refrain\n
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
let the earth hear his voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father thru Jesus the Son,
and give him the glory, great things he hath done!
2\n
O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
to every believer the promise of God;
the vilest offender who truly believes,
that moment from Jesus a pardon receives.
3\n
Great things he hath taught us, great things he hath done,
and great our rejoicing thru Jesus the Son; 
but purer, and higher, and greater will be
our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.
344  I Love Your Kingdom, Lord+
1\n
I love thy kingdom, Lord,
the house of thine abode,
the church our blest Redeemer saved
with his own precious blood.
2\n
I love thy church, O God!
Her walls before thee stand
dear as the apple of thine eye,
and graven on thy hand.
3\n
Beyond my highest joy
I prize her heavenly ways,
her sweet communion, solemn vows,
her hymns of love and praise.
5\n
Sure as thy truth shall last,
to Zion shall be given
the brightest glories earth can yield,
and brighter bliss of heaven. 
348  The Church Has One Foundation+
1\n
The church's one foundation
is Jesus Christ her Lord;
she is his new creation
by water and the Word.
From heaven he came and sought her
to be his holy bride;
with his own blood he bought her,
and for her life he died.
2\n
Elect from every nation,
yet one o'er all the earth;
her charter of salvation,
one Lord, one faith, one birth;
one holy name she blesses,
partakes one holy food,
and to one hope she presses,
with every grace endued.
3\n
Though with a scornful wonder
we see her sore oppressed,
by schisms rent asunder,
by heresies distressed,
yet saints their watch are keeping; 
their cry goes up, "How long?"
And soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song.
4\n
'Mid toil and tribulation,
and tumult of her war,
she waits the consummation
of peace forevermore;
till, with the vision glorious,
her longing eyes are blest,
and the great church victorious
shall be the church at rest.
350  Blest Be the Tie That Binds+
1\n
Blest be the tie that binds
our hearts in Christian love;
the fellowship of kindred minds
is like to that above.
2\n
Before our Father's throne 
we pour our ardent prayers;
our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
our comforts and our cares.
3\n
We share each other's woes,
our mutual burdens bear;
and often for each other flows
the sympathizing tear.
4\n
When we asunder part,
it gives us inward pain;
but we shall still be joined in heart,
and hope to meet again.
355  Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life+
1\n
Where cross the crowded ways of life,
where sound the cries of race and clan,
above the noise of selfish strife,
we hear your voice, O Son of Man.
2\n
From tender childhood's helplessness,
from woman's grief, man's burdened toil,
from famished souls, from sorrow's stress, 
your heart has never known recoil.
3\n
The cup of water given for you still
holds the freshness of your grace;
yet long these multitudes to view
the sweet compassion of your face.
4\n
O Master, from the mountainside
make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
among these restless throngs abide;
O tread the city's streets again.
5\n
Till all the world shall learn your love
and follow where your feet have trod,
till, glorious from your heaven above,
shall come the city of our God.
358  Far and Near the Fields Are Teeming+
1\n
Far and near the fields are teeming
with the sheaves of ripened grain; 
Far and near their gold is gleaming
O'er the summy slope and plain.
Refrain\n
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
Hear us Lord,to Thee we cry;
Send them now the sheaves to gather,
Ere the harvest-time pass by.
2\n
Send them forth with morn's first beaming,
Send them in the noon-tides's glare;
When the sun's last rays are streaming,
bid them gather everywhere.
3\n
O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,
gather now the sheaves of gold;
Heavenward then at evening wending
Thou shalt come with joy untold.
365  O Zion, Haste+
1\n
O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,
to tell to all the world that God is light,
that he who made all nations is not willing
one soul should perish, lost in shades of night. 
Refrain\n
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.
2\n
Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation
that God, in whom they live and move, is love;
tell how he stooped to save his lost creation,
and died on earth that we might live above.
3\n
Give of thine own to bear the message glorious;
give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;
pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;
O Zion, haste to bring the brighter day.
4\n
He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,
Make known to every heart His saving grace;
Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,
Through thy neglect, unfit to see His face.
367  Rescue the Perishing+
1\n
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; 
weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.
Refrain\n
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
2\n
Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,
waiting the penitent child to receive;
plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
he will forgive if they only believe.
3\n
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
back to the narrow way patiently win them;
tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.
370  Christ for the World+
1\n
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,
with loving zeal;
the poor, and them that mourn,
the faint and overborne, 
sinsick and sorrow-worn,
whom Christ doth heal.
2\n
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,
with fervent prayer;
the wayward and the lost,
by restless passions tossed,
redeemed at countless cost,
from dark despair.
3\n
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,
with joyful song;
the newborn souls, whose days,
reclaimed from error's ways,
inspired with hope and praise,
to Christ belong.
373  Seeking the Lost+
1\n
Seeking the lost-yes, kindly entreating
Wanderers on the mountain astray
"Come unto Me," His message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking today.
Refrain\n 
Ladies: (Going afar) (Upon the mountain)
Men: Going afar Upon the moun-tain
Ladies: (Bringing the wand'rer back again,) back again
Men: Bringing the wand'+rer back again, back again
Ladies: Into the fold of my Redeemer,
Men: Into the fold of my Redeem-er
Ladies: (Jesus the Lamb +for sinners slain,) for sinners slain
Men: Jesus, the lamb +for sinners slain, for sinners slain
2\n
Seeking the lost-and pointing to Jesus
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life evermore.
3\n
Thus I would go on missions of mercy
Following Christ from day unto day,
Cheering the faint and raising the fallen,
Pointing the lost to Jesus, the Way
*
NOTE: On the Refrain\n, the men start, the ladies echo, and the
oices join again at the
+'s.
385  Crowning Jewel of Creation+
1\n
Crowning jewel of creation,
Blest and hallowed, sanctified;
Time and changes all transcending,
Shared forever, glorified.
Refrain\n
Blessed Sabbath made for man,
Gift from the Creator's hand.
2\n
Sin and sickness, prayer and weeping
Cease at close of earthly days;
But Thy Sabbath is eternal,
Joyful thanks to Thee we raise!
3\n
Teach us Lord, in storm or sunshine
How to truly rest in Thee,
May Thy Sabbath peace enfold us
And our shelter ever be.
401  In Imitation, Lord of Thee+
1\n
In imitation, Lord, of Thee, 
This solemn service we repeat;
For Thine example full of grace,
Has made this humble duty sweet.
2\n
Renew each sacred spark of love,
And vitalize the holy flame;
May union strong our hearts unite
While this we do in Jesus' name.
3\n
Our great example Thou shalt be,
In washing Thy disciples feet;
And as we follow Thy command,
Make Thou our fellowship complete.
404  Now Let Us From This Table Rise+
1\n
Now let us from this table rise
Renewed in body, mind, and soul;
With Christ we die and live again,
His selfless love has made us whole. 
2\n
With minds alert, upheld by grace,
To spread the word in speech and deed,
We follow in the steps of Christ,
At one with all in hope and need.
3\n
To fill each human house with love,
It is the sacrament of care;
The work that Christ began to do
We humbly pledge ourselves to share.
4\n
Then grant us courage, Father God,
To choose again the pilgrim way
And help us to accept with joy
The challenge of tomorrow's day.
413  God Has Spoken by His Prophets+
1\n
God has spoken by His prophets,
Spoken His unchanging Word,
Each from age to age proclaiming
God, the one, the righteous Lord.
Mid the world's despair and turmoil,
One firm anchor holding fast;
God is King, His throne eternal, 
God the first, and God the last.
2\n
God has spoken by Christ Jesus,
Christ, the everlasting Son,
Brightness of the Father's glory,
With the Father ever one;
Spoken by the Word incarnate,
God of God, ere time began,
Light of light, to earth descending,
Man, revealing God to man.
3\n
God yet speaks by His own Spirit
Speaking to the hearts of men,
In the age-long Word expounding
God's own message, now as then;
Through the rise and fall of nations
One sure faith yet standing fast,
God is King, His Word unchanging,
God the first, and God the last.
421  For All the Saints+
1\n 
For all the saints
who from their labors rest,
Who thee by faith
before the world confessed.
Thy name, O Jesus,
be forever blest.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!
2\n
Thou wast their Rock,
their Fortress and their Might;
Thou, Lord, their captain
in the well-fought fight;
Thou, in the darkness drear,
their one true light.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!
3\n
O may Thy soldiers,
faithful, true, and bold,
Fight as the saints
who nobly fought of old,
And win with them
the victor's crown of gold.
Alleluia!
Alleluia! 
4\n
And when the strife is fierce,
the warfare long,
Steals on the ear
the distant triumph song,
And hearts are brave again,
and arms are strong.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!
5\n
From earth's wide bounds,
from ocean's farthest coast,
Thro' gates of pearl
streams in the countless host,
Singing to Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost,
Alleluia!
Alleluia!
422  Marching to Zion+
1\n
Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord, 
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.
Refrain\n
We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.
2\n
Let those refuse to sing,
Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King,
But children of the heavenly King,
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad.
3\n
The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.
4\n
Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry; 
We're marching through Immanuel's ground
We're marching through Immanuel's ground
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high.
423  Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken+
1\n
Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
He whose word cannot be broken
Formed thee for His own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's wall surrounded,
Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.
2\n
See the streams of living waters
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear and want remove;
Who can faint when such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,
Never fails from age to age.
3\n 
Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear
For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is near;
Blest inhabitants of Zion,
Washed in the Redeemer's blood;
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
Makes them kings and priests to God.
4\n
Savior, if of Zion's city
I, through grace, a member am,
Let the world deride or pity,
I will glory in Thy name;
Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
All his boasted pomp and show;
Solid joys and lasting treasure
None but Zion's children know.
428  Sweet By and By+
1\n
There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar; 
For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place there.
Refrain\n
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
2\n
We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessings of rest.
3\n
To our bountiful Father above,
We will offer a tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love,
And the blessings that hallow our days.
432  Shall We Gather at the River+
1\n
Shall we gather at the river,
where bright angel feet have trod,
with its crystal tide forever
flowing by the throne of God. 
Refrain\n
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
the beautiful, the beautiful river;
gather with the sains at the river
that flows by the throne of God.
2\n
On the margin of the river
washing up its silver spray,
we will walk and worship ever,
all the happy golden day.
3\n
Ere we reach the shining river,
lay we ev'ry burden down;
grace our spirits will deliver,
and provide a robe and crown.
4\n
Soon we'll reach the shining river,
soon our pilgrimage will cease;
soon our happy hearts will quiver
with the melody of peace. 
452  What Heavenly Music+
1\n
What heavenly music steals over the sea!
Entrancing the senses like sweet melody!
'Tis the voice of the angels borne soft on the air;
For me they are singing; their welcome I hear.
2\n
On the banks of old Jordan, here gazing I stand,
And earnestly longing, I stretch forth my hand;
Send a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray!
Let me join that sweet music; come, take me away.
3\n
Though dark are the waters and rough is the wave,
If Jesus permit, the wild surges I'll brave;
For that heavenly music hath ravished me so,
I must join in that chorus! I'll go! let me go!
456  My Lord and I+
1\n
I have a Friend so precious, 
So very dear to me,
He loves me with such tender love,
He loves so faithfully;
I could not live apart form Him,
I love to feel Him nigh,
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.
2\n
Sometimes I'm faint and weary,
He knows that I am weak,
And as He bids me lean on Him,
His help I gladly seek;
He leads me in the paths of light,
Beneath a sunny sky,
And so we walk together,
My Lord and I.
3\n
I tell Him all my sorrows,
I tell Him all my joys,
I tell Him all that pleases me,
I tell Him what annoys;
He tells me what I ought to do,
He tells me how to try,
And so we talk together,
My Lord and I.
4\n 
He knows that I am longing
Some weary soul to win,
And so He bids me go and speak
The loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love,
And why He came to die,
And so we work together,
My Lord and I.
457  I Love to Tell the Story+
1\n
I love to tell the story
of unseen things above,
of Jesus and his glory,
of Jesus and his love.
I love to tell the story,
because I know 'tis true;
it satisfies my longings
as nothing else can do.
Refrain\n
I love to tell the story,
'twill be my theme in glory, 
to tell the old, old story
of Jesus and his love.
2\n
I love to tell the story;
more wonderful it seems
than all the golden fancies
of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story,
it did so much for me;
and that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee.
3\n
I love to tell the story;
'tis pleasant to repeat
what seems, each time I tell it,
more wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story,
for some have never heard
the message of salvation
from God's own holy Word.
4\n
I love to tell the story,
for those who know it best
seem hungering and thirsting
to hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory, 
I sing the new, new song,
'twill be the old, old story
that I have loved so long.
458  More Love to Thee+
1\n
More love to thee, O Christ, more love to thee!
Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.
This is my earnest plea: More love, O Christ, to thee;
more love to thee, more love to thee!
2\n
Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;
now thee alone I seek, give what is best.
This all my prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;
more love to thee, more love to thee!
3\n
Let sorrow do its work, come grief and pain;
sweet are thy messengers, sweet their Refrain\n,
when they can sing with me: More love, O Christ, to thee;
more love to thee, more love to thee!
4\n 
Then shall my latest breath whisper thy praise;
this be the parting cry my heart shall raise;
this still its prayer shall be: More love, O Christ, to thee;
more love to thee, more love to thee!
462  Blessed Assurance, Jesus is Mine!+

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
O what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.
Refrain\n
This is my story, this is my song,
praising my Savior all the day long;
this is my story, this is my song,
praising my Savior all the day long.
2\n
Perfect submission, perfect delight,
visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
angels descending bring from above
echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
3\n
Perfect submission, all is at rest;
I in my Savior am happy and blest, 
watching and waiting, looking above,
filled with his goodness, lost in his love.
463  Peace, Perfect Peace+
1\n
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
2\n
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
To do the will of Jesus: this is rest.
3\n
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.
4\n
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
469  Leaning on the Everlasting Arms+
1\n
What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
leaning on the everlasting arms;
what a blessedness, what a peace is mine, 
leaning on the everlasting arms.
Refrain\n

safe and secure from all alarms;
leaning, leaning,
leaning on the everlasting arms.

O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
leaning on the everlasting arms;
O how bright the path grows from day to day,
leaning on the everlasting arms.
(Refrain\n)

What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
leaning on the everlasting arms?
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
leaning on the everlasting arms.

More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky,
For Jesus is my light. 
Refrain\n
O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
When the peaceful, happy moments roll
When Jesus shows His smiling face
There is sunshine in the soul.
2\n
There's music in my soul today,
A carol to my King,
And Jesus, listening, can hear
The songs I cannot sing.
3\n
There's springtime in my soul today,
For when the Lord is near,
The dove of peace sings in my heart,
The flowers of grace appear.
4\n
Theres gladness in my soul today,
And hope, and praise, and love,
For blessings which He gives me now,
For joys "laid up" above.
473  Nearer My God, to Thee +
1\n
Nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me,
still all my song shall be,
nearer, my God, to thee;
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
2\n
Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,
darkness be over me, my rest a stone;
yet in my dreams I'd be
nearer, my God, to thee;
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
3\n
There let the way appear, steps unto heaven;
all that thou sendest me, in mercy given;
angels to beckon me
nearer, my God, to thee;
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
4\n
Then, with my waking thoughts bright with thy praise,
out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;
so by my woes to be
nearer, my God, to thee;
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee! 
5\n
Or if, on joyful wing cleaving the sky,
sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I fly,
still all my song shall be,
nearer, my God, to thee;
nearer, my God, to thee, nearer to thee!
477  Come, Ye Disconsolate+
1\n
Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish.
come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel.
Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.
2\n
Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,
hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure!
Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,
"Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure."
3\n
Here see the bread of life; waters flowing
forth from the throne of God, pure from above.
Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing
earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove. 
478  Sweet Hour of Prayer+
1\n
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
that calls me from a world of care,
and bids me at my Father's throne
make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief,
my soul has often found relief,
and oft escaped the tempter's snare
by thy return, sweet hour of prayer!
2\n
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
thy wings shall my petition bear
to him whose truth and faithfulness
engage the waiting soul to bless.
And since he bids me seek his face,
believe his word, and trust his grace,
I'll cast on him my every care,
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!
3\n
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
May I thy consolation share
Till from Mount Pisgah's lofty height 
I view my home and take my flight.
In my immortal flesh I'll rise
To size the everlasting prize.
And shout while passing through the air,
"Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"
481  Dear Lord and Father+
1\n
Dear Lord and Father of mankind,
forgive our foolish ways;
reclothe us in our rightful mind,
in purer lives thy service find,
in deeper reverence, praise.
2\n
In simple trust like theirs who heard,
beside the Syrian sea,
the gracious calling of the Lord,
let us, like them, without a word,
rise up and follow thee.
3\n
O sabbath rest by Galilee,
O calm of hills above, 
where Jesus knelt to share with thee
the silence of eternity,
interpreted by love!
4\n
Drop thy still dews of quietness,
till all our strivings cease;
take from our souls the strain and stress,
and let our ordered lives confess
the beauty of thy peace.
5\n
Breathe through the heats of our desire
thy coolness and thy balm;
let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;
speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,
O still, small voice of calm.
483  I Need Thee Every Hour+
1\n
I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord;
no tender voice like thine can peace afford.
Refrain\n
I need thee, O I need thee;
every hour I need thee;
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to thee. 
2\n
I need thee every hour; stay thou nearby;
temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.
3\n
I need thee every hour, in joy or pain;
come quickly and abide, or life is vain.
4\n
I need thee every hour; teach me thy will;
and thy rich promises in me fulfill.
484  I Need Thee, Precious Jesus+
1\n
I need Thee precious Jesus, for I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim, I have no earthly store.
I need the love of Jesus to cheer me on my way,
To guide my doubting foot steps, to be my strength and stay.
2\n
I need the heart of Jesus to feel each anxious care,
To tell my every trial, and all my sorrows share.
I need the Holy Spirit to teach me what I am,
To show me more of Jesus, to point me to the Lamb. 
3\n
I need Thee precious Jesus, I hope to see Thee soon,
Encircled with the rainbow, and seated on Thy throne.
There with Thy blood-bought children, my joy shall ever be
To sing Thy ceaseless praises, to gaze, my Lord, on Thee.
491  In the Hour of Trial+
1\n
In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
When Thou see'st me waver, with a look recall,
Nor, for fear or favor, suffer me to fall.
2\n
With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm;
Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;
Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,
Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.
3\n
Should Thy mercy send me sorrow, toil, and woe,
Or should pain attend me on my path below,
Grant that I may never fail Thy hand to see; 
Grant that I may ever cast my care on Thee.
495  Near to the Heart of God+
1\n
There is a place of quiet rest,
near to the heart of God;
a place where sin cannot molest,
near to the heart of God.
Refrain\n
O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
sent from the heart of God,
hold us who wait before thee
near to the heart of God.
2\n
There is a place of comfort sweet,
near to the heart of God;
a place where we our Savior meet,
near to the heart of God.
3\n
There is place a place of full release, 
near to the heart of God;
a place where all is joy and peace,
near to the heart of God.
499  What a Friend We Have in Jesus+
1\n
What a friend we have in Jesus,
all our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
all because we do not carry
everything to God in prayer.
2\n
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
take it to the Lord in prayer.
3\n
Are we weak and heavy laden, 
cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge;
take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In his arms he'll take and shield thee;
thou wilt find a solace there.
500  Take Time to Be Holy+
1\n
Take time to be holy,
speak oft with thy Lord;
abide in him always,
and feed on his word.
Make friends of God's children,
help those who are weak,
forgetting in nothing
his blessing to seek.
2\n
Take time to be holy,
the world rushes on;
spend much time in secret
with Jesus alone. 
By looking to Jesus,
like him thou shalt be;
thy friends in thy conduct
his likeness shall see.
3\n
Take time to be holy,
let him be thy guide,
and run not before him,
whatever betide.
In joy or in sorrow,
still follow the Lord,
and, looking to Jesus,
still trust in his word.
4\n
Take time to be holy,
be calm in thy soul,
each thought and each motive
beneath his control.
Thus led by his spirit
to fountains of love,
thou soon shalt be fitted
for service above. 
506  A Mighty Fortress+
1\n
A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing;
our helper he amid the flood
of mortal ills prevaling.
For still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.
2\n
Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right man on our side,
the man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is he;
Lord Sabbaoth, his name,
from age to age the same,
and he must win the battle.
3\n
And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God hath willed 
his truth to triumph through us.
The Prince of Darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
for lo, his doom is sure;
one little word shall fell him.
4\n
That word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, abideth;
the Spirit and the gifts are ours,
thru him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill;
God's truth abideth still;
his kingdom is forever.
508  Anywhere With Jesus+
1\n
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
Anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade;
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid. 
Refrain\n
Anywhere! Anywhere!
Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus
I can safely go.
2\n
Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.
3\n
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the gloomy shadows round about me creep,
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
Anywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home.
516  All the Way+
1\n
All the way my Savior leads me;
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who through life has been my guide?
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell;
For I know whate'er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well; 
For I know whate'er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well.
2\n
All the way my Savior leads me;
Cheers each winding path I tread;
Gives me grace for every trial,
Feeds me with the living bread;
Though my weary steps may falter,
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo, a spring of joy I see;
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo, a spring of joy I see.
3\n
All the way my Savior leads me;
O the fullness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father's house above;
When I wake to life immortal,
Wing my flight to realms of day,
This my song through endless ages,
Jesus led me all the way;
This my song through endless ages,
Jesus led me all the way. 
517  My Faith Looks Up to Thee+
1\n
My faith looks up to thee,
thou Lamb of Calvary,
Savior divine;
Now hear me while I pray,
take all my guilt away,
O let me from this day
be wholly Thine.
2\n
May thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart,
my zeal inspire!
As thou hast died for me,
O may my love to thee
pure, warm, and changeless be,
a living fire!
3\n
While life's dark maze I tread,
and griefs around me spread,
be thou my guide;
bid darkness turn to day,
wipe sorrow's tears away,
nor let me ever stray
from Thee aside. 
518  Standing on the Promises+
1\n
Standing on the promises
of Christ my King,
Thru eternal ages
let His praises ring;
Glory in the highest
I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.
Refrain\n
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises
of God my Savior;
Standing,standing,
I'm standing on the promises of God.
2\n
Standing on the promises
that cannot fail,
When the howling storms
of doubt and fear assail,
By the living word of
God I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.
3\n
Standing on the promises 
of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally
by love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily with
the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God.
520  He Hideth My Soul+
1\n
A wonderful Savior
is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful
Savior to me,
He hideth my soul in
the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of
pleasure I see.
Refrain\n
He hideth my soul in
the cleft of the rock
That shadows a
dry, thirsty land;
he hideth my life in
the depths of His love,
And covers me
there with His hand, 
And covers me
there with His hand.
2\n
A wonderful Savior
is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my
burden away,
He holdeth me up, and
I shall not be moved,
He giveth me
strength as my day.
3\n
With numberless blessings
each moment He crowns,
And filled with
His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture,
Oh, Glory to God
For such a
Redeemer as mine.
4\n
When clothed in His
brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in
clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, 
His wonderful love,
I'll shout with
the millions on high.
521  Depth of Mercy+
1\n
Depth of mercy!--can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear?
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?
2\n
I have long withstood His grace,
Long provoked Him to His face,
Would not hearken to His calls,
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.
3\n
Now incline me to repent;
Let me now my sins lament;
Now my foul revolt deplore,
Weep, believe, and sin no more.
4\n
There for me the Savior stands,
Shows His wounds and spreads His hands; 
God is love! I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
522  My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less+
1\n
My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
but wholly leand on Jesus' name.
Refrain\n
On Christ the solid rock I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
all other ground is sinking sand.
2\n
When Darkness veils his lovely face,
I rest on his unchanging grace.
in every high and stormy gale,
my anchor holds within the veil.
3\n
His oath, his covenant, his blood
supports me in the whelming flood.
When all around my soul gives way,
he then is all my hope and stay. 
4\n
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in him be found!
Dressed in his righteousness alone,
faultless to stand before the throne.
524  'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus+
1\n
'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
and to take him at his word;
just to rest upon his promise,
and to know, "Thus saith the Lord."
Refrain\n
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
How I've proved him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust him more!
2\n
O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
just to trust his cleansing blood;
and in simple faith to plunge me
neath the healing, cleansing flood! 
3\n
Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
just from sin and self to cease;
just from Jesus simply taking
life and rest, and joy and peace.

I'm so glad I learned to trust thee,
precious Jesus, Savior, friend;
and I know that thou art with me,
wilt be with me to the end.

529  Under His Wings+

Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;
he has redeemed me, and I am His child. 
Refrain\n
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings, my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.

Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, and there I am blest.
3\n
Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till life's trials are over;
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.
530  It Is Well With My Soul+
1\n
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
when sorrows like sea billows roll;
whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.
Refrain\n 
It is well with my soul,
it is well, it is well with my soul.
2\n
My sin, -oh, the joy of this glorious thought-
My sin, not in part but the whole,
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
3\n
And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
the trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
even so, it is well with my soul.
537  He Leadeth Me+
1\n
He leadeth me: O blessed thought!
O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.
Refrain\n
He leadeth me, he leadeth me,
by his own hand he leadeth me;
his faithful follower I would be, 
for by his hand he leadeth me.
2\n
Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,
sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
by waters still, o'er troubled sea,
still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.
3\n
Lord, I would place my hand in thine,
nor ever murmur nor repine;
content, whatever lot I see,
since 'tis my God that leadeth me.
4\n
And when my task on earth is done,
when by thy grace the victory's won,
e'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
since God through Jordan leadeth me.
538  Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah+
1\n
Guide me, O thou great Jehovah,
pilgrim through this barren land. 
I am weak, but thou art mighty;
hold me with thy powerful hand.
Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,
feed me till I want no more;
feed me till I want no more.
2\n
Open now the crystal fountain,
whence the healing stream doth flow;
let the fire and cloudy pillar
lead me all my journey through.
Strong deliverer, strong deliverer,
be thou still my strength and shield;
be thou still my strength and shield.
3\n
When I tread the verge of Jordan,
bid my anxious fears subside;
death of death and hell's destruction,
land me safe on Canaan's side.
Songs of praises, songs of praises,
I will ever give to thee;
I will ever give to thee.
541  Lord, Speak to Me+
1\n
Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
in living echoes of thy tone;
as thou has sought, so let me seek 
thine erring children lost and lone.
2\n
O lead me, Lord, that I may lead
the wandering and the wavering feet;
O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
thy hungering ones with manna sweet.
3\n
O strengthen me, that while I stand
firm on the rock, and strong in thee,
I may stretch out a loving land
to wrestlers with the troubled sea.

Hear, O hear us when we pray.

Hear, O hear us when we pray.

Thou hast promised to receive us,
poor and sinful though we be;
thou hast mercy to relieve us,
grace to cleanse and power to free.

We will early turn to thee.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus!
We will early turn to thee.
548  Now Praise the Hidden God of Love+
1\n 
Now praise the hidden God of love
In whom we all must live and move,
Who shepherds us, at every stage
Thro' youth, maturity, and age.
2\n
Who challenged us, when were young
To storm the citadels of wrong;
In care for others taught us how
God's true community must grow.
3\n
Who bids us never lose our zest,
Tho' age is urging us to rest,
But proves to us that we have still
A work to do, a place to fill.
4\n
Then talk no more of wasted time,
But Godward look, and upward climb,
Content to sleep, when day is done,
And rise refreshed, and travel on.
551  Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me+
1\n
Jesus, Savior, pilot me
over life's tempestuous sea; 
unknown waves before me roll,
hiding rock and treacherous shoal.
Chart and compass come from thee;
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
2\n
As a mother stills her child,
thou canst hush the ocean wild;
boisterous waves obey thy will,
when thou sayest to them, "Be still!"
Wondrous sovreign of the sea,
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
3\n
When at last I near the shore,
and the fearful breakers roar
'twixt me and the peaceful rest,
then, while leaning on thy breast,
may I hear thee say to me,
"Fear not, I will pilot thee."
554  O Let Me Walk With Thee+
1\n
O let me walk with Thee, my God,
As Enoch walked in days of old;
Place Thou my trembling hand in Thine,
And sweet communion with me hold; 
E'en though the path I may not see,
Yet, Jesus, let me walk with Thee.
2\n
I cannot, dare not, walk alone;
The tempest rages in the sky,
A thousand snares beset my feet,
A thousand foes are lurking nigh.
Still Thou the raging of the sea,
O Master! let me walk with Thee.
3\n
If I may rest my hand in Thine,
I'll count the joys of earth but loss,
And firmly, bravely journey on;
I'll bear the banner of the cross
Till Zion's glorious gates I see;
Yet, Savior, let me walk with Thee.
559  Now Thank We All Our God+
1\n
Now thank we all our God,
with heart and hands and voices,

has blessed us on our way 
with countless gifts of love,
and still is ours today.
2\n
O may this bounteous God
through all our life be near us,
with ever joyful hearts
and blessed peace to cheer us;
and keep us still in grace,
and guide us when perplexed;
and free us from all ills,
in this world and the next.
3\n
All praise and thanks to God
the Father now be given;

with them in highest heaven;
the one eternal God,
whom earth and heaven adore;
for thus it was, is now,
and shall be evermore.
565  For the Beauty of the Earth +

this our grateful song of praise.

brother, sister, parent, child,
friends on earth and friends above,
Pleasures pure and undefiled,
Lord of all, to Thee we raise
this our grateful song of praise.
3\n
For the gift of Thy dear Son,
for the hope of heaven at last,
for the Spirit's victory won,
For the crown when life is past,
Lord of all, to Thee we raise
Songs of gratitude and praise.
567  Have Thine Own Way, Lord+
1\n
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! 
Thou art the potter, I am the clay.
Mold me and make me after thy will,
while I am waiting, yielded and still.
2\n
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Search me and try me, Savior today!
Wash me just now, Lord, wash me just now,
as in thy presence humbly I bow.
3\n
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me I pray!
Power, all power, surely is thine!
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine!
4\n
Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Hold o'er my being absolute sway.
Fill with thy Spirit till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me!

hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling, 
do not pass me by.
Refrain\n
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling,
do not pass me by.
2\n
Let me at thy throne of mercy
find a sweet relief,
kneeling there in deep contrition;
help my unbelief.
3\n
Trusting only in thy merit,
would I seek thy face;
heal my wounded, broken spirit,
save me by thy grace.
4\n
Thou the spring of all my comfort,
more than life to me,
whom have I on earth beside thee?
Whom in heaven but thee? 
572  Give of Your Best to the Master+
1\n
Give of your best to the master,
Give of the strength of your youth;
Throw your soul's fresh, glowing ardor
Into the battle for truth.

Dauntless was He, young and brave;
Give Him your loyal devotion,
Give Him the best that you have
Refrain\n
Give of your best to the master,
Give of the strength of your youth;
Clad in salvation's full armor,
Join in the battle for truth.

Give Him first place in your service,
Consecrate every part.
Give, and to you shall be given -
God His beloved Son gave;
Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
Give Him the best that you have.
3\n 
Give of your best to the Master,
Naught else is worthy His love;
He gave Himself for your ransom,
Have up His glory above;
Laid down His life without murmur,
You from sin's ruin to save;
Give Him your heart's adoration,
Give Him the best that you have.
574  O Master, Let Me Walk With Thee+
1\n
O Master, let me walk with thee
in lowly paths of service free;
tell me thy secret; help me bear
the strain of toil, the fret of care.
2\n
Help me the slow of heart to move
by some clear, winning word of love;
teach me the wayward feet to stay,
and guide them in the homeward way.
3\n
Teach me thy patience; still with thee
in closer, dearer company, 
in work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
in trust that triumphs over wrong;
4\n
In hope that sends a shining ray
far down the future's broadening way,
in peace that only thou canst give,
with thee, O Master, let me live.
576  Awake, Awake to Love and Work+
1\n
Awake, awake to love and work!
The lark is in the sky;
The fields are wet with diamond dew;
The worlds awake to cry
Their blessings on the Lord of life,
As He goes meekly by.
2\n
Come, let thy voice be one with theirs,
Shout with their shout of praise;
See how the giant sun soars up,
Great lord of years and days!
So let the love of Jesus come
And set thy soul ablaze.
3\n 
To give and give, and give again,
What God hath given thee;
To spend thyself nor count the cost;
To serve right gloriously
The God who gave all worlds that are,
And all that are to be.
590  Trust and Obey+
1\n
When we walk with the Lord
in the light of his word,
what a glory he sheds on our way!
While we do his good will,
he abides with us still,
and with all who will trust and obey.
Refrain\n
Trust and obey, for there's no other way
to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
2\n
Not a shadow can rise,
not a cloud in the skies,
but his smile quickly drives it away;
not a doubt nor a fear,
not a sigh nor a tear,
can abide while we trust and obey. 
3\n
Not a burden we bear,
not a sorrow we share,
but our toil he doth richly repay;
not a grief or a loss,
not a frown or a cross,
but is blest if we trust and obey.
4\n
But we never can prove
the delights of his love
until all on the altar we lay;
for the favor he shows,
and the joy he bestows,
are for them who will trust and obey.
(Refrain\n)
5\n
Then in fellowship sweet
we will sit at his feet,
or we'll walk by his side in the way;
what he says we will do,
where he sends we will go;
never fear, only trust and obey. 
591  In Our Work and in Our Play+

In our work and in our play,
Jesus, ever with us stay;

True and faithful unto Thee.

Evil tempers, words untrue,
Thoughts impure, and deeds unkind,
All things hateful to Thy mind.
Then we truthfully can sing,
We are children of the King.

Children of the King are we!
May we loyal to Him be;
Try to please Him every day,
In our work and in our play.
Then we truthfully can sing,
We are children of the King.
594  Heir of the Kingdom+

Heir of the kingdom, O why dost thou slumber?
Why art thou sleeping so near thy blest home?
Wake thee, arouse thee, and gird on thine armor,
Speed, for the moments are hurrying on.
2\n
Heir of the kingdom, say, why dost thou linger?
How canst thou tarry in sight of the prize?
Up, and adorn thee, the Savior is coming;
Haste to receive Him descending the skies.
3\n
Earth's mighty nations, in strife and commotion,
Tremble with terror, and sink in dismay;
Listen, 'tis nought but the chariot's loud rumbling;
Heir of the kingdom, no longer delay.
4\n
Stay not, O stay not for earth's vain allurements!
See how its glory is passing away;
Break the strong fetters the foe hath bound o'er thee;
Heir of the kingdom, turn, turn thee away.
5\n
Keep the eye single, the head upward lifted;
Watch for the glory of earth's coming King;
Lo! o'er the mountaintops light is now breaking;
Heirs of the kingdom, rejoice ye and sing. 
595  Let Every Lamp Be Burning+
1\n
Let every lamp be burning bright,
The darkest hour is nearing;
The darkest hour of earth's long night,
Before the Lord's appearing.
Refrain\n
Then trim your lamps, my brethren dear,
Then trim your lamps with godly fear;
The Master's coming draweth near,
Let every lamp be burning.

The last great message spuring,
Wel'll rest our living faith upon
His promise of returning.
3\n
His word our lamp, His truth our guide,
We cannot be mistaken;
Though dangers rise on every side,
We shall not be forsaken.

To help the world atound us;
Obedience bring the blessing near
When faith has firmly bound us.
601  Watchmen, on the Walls of Zion+
1\n
Watchmen, on the walls of Zion,
What O tell us, of the night?
Is the daystar now arising?
Will the morn soon greet our sight?
O'er your vision Shine there now
some rays of light?
O'er your vision Shine there now
some rays of light?
2\n
Tell, O tell us, are the landmarks
On our voyage all passed by?
Are we nearing now the haven?
Can we e'en the land descry?
Do we truly See the heavenly kingdom nigh? 
Do we truly See the heavenly kingdom nigh?

Pure and bright in yonder sky!

Soon the haven will appear;

Let your voices Sound aloud your holy cheer.
604  We Know Not the Hour+

We know not the hour of the Master's appearing;
Yet signs all foretell that the moment is nearing
When He shall return 'tis the promise most cheering
But we know not the hour.
Refrain\n
He will come, let us watch and be ready; 
He will come, hallelujah! hallelujah!
He will come in the clouds of His Father's
bright glory but we know not the hour.
2\n
There's light for the wise who are seeking salvation;
There's truth in the book of the Lord's revelation;
Each prophecy points to the great comsummation
But we know not the hour.
3\n
We'll watch and we'll pray, with our lamps trimmed and burning;
We'll work and we'll wait till the Master's returning;
We'll sing and rejoice, every omen discerning
But we know not the hour.
609  Am I a Soldier of the Cross?+
1\n
Am I a soldier of the cross,
a follower of the Lamb,
and shall I fear to own his cause,
or blush to speak his name?
2\n
Must I be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease,
while others fought to win the prize, 
and sailed through bloody seas?
3\n
Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
to help me on to God?
4\n
Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
increase my courage, Lord.
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
supported by thy word.
5\n
Thy saints in all this glorious war
shall conquer though they die;
they see the triumph from afar,
by faith they bring it nigh.

When that illustrious day shall rise,
and all thy armies shine
in robes of victory through the skies,
the glory shall be thine. 
612  Onward, Christian Soldiers!+

Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,
with the cross of Jesus going on before.

Like a mighty army moves the church of God;
brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod.
We are not divided, all one body we,
one in hope and doctrine, one in charity.
3\n
Crowns and thrones my perish, kingdoms rise and wane,
but the church of Jesus constant will remain.
Gates of hell can never 'gainst that church prevail;
we have Christ's own promise, and that cannot fail.
4\n
Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng,
blend with ours your voices in the triumph song.
Glory, laud, and honor unto Christ the King,
this through countless ages men and angels sing. 
614  Sound the Battle Cry+

For the Lord;

Stand firm, every one,
Rest your cause upon His holy word.

Rouse, then soldiers!
rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.

Marching on we go,
While our cause we know
Must prevail;
Shield and banner bring,
Gleaming in the light,
Battling for the right,
We ne'er can fail. 
3\n
O Thou God of all,
Hear us when we call,
Help us, one and all,
By Thy grace;
When the battle's done,
And the victory won,
May we wear the crown
Before Thy face.

Rise up, O men of God!
His kingdom tarries long.

and end the night of wrong.

Have done with lesser things.
Give heart and mind and soul and strength
to serve the King of kings.
3\n
Rise up, O men of God! 
The church for you doth wait,
her strength unequal to her task;
rise up, and make her great!

Lift high the cross of Christ!
Tread where his feet have trod.
Disciples of the Son of Man,
rise up, O church of God!
618  Stand Up! Stand Up for Jesus!+
1\n
Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
ye soldiers of the cross;
lift high his royal banner,
it must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory
his army shall he lead,
till every foe is vanquished,
and Christ is Lord indeed.
2\n
Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
the trumpet call obey;
forth to the mighty conflict,
in this his glorious day.
Ye that are brave now serve him 
against unnumbered foes;
let courage rise with danger,
and strength to strength oppose.
3\n
Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
stand in his strength alone;
the arm of flesh will fail you,
ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the gospel armor,
each piece put on with prayer;
where duty calls or danger,
be never wanting there.
4\n
Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
the strife will not be long;
this day the noise of battle,
the next the victor's song.
To those who vanquish evil
a crown of life shall be;
they with the King of Glory
shall reign eternally. 
619  Lead On, O King Eternal+
1\n
Lead on, O King eternal,
the day of march has come;
henceforth in fields of conquest
thy tents shall be our home.
Through days of preparation
thy grace has made us strong;
and now, O King eternal,
we lift our battle song.
2\n
Lead on, O King eternal,
till sin's fierce war shall cease,
and holiness shall whisper
the sweet amen of peace.
For not with swords loud clashing,
nor roll of stirring drums;
with deeds of love and mercy
the heavenly kingdom comes.
3\n
Lead on, O King eternal,
we follow, not with fears,
for gladness breaks like morning
where'er thy face appears.
Thy cross is lifted o'er us,
we journey in its light; 
the crown awaits the conquest;
lead on, O God of might.
623  I Will Follow Thee+

Thou didst shed Thy blood for me;
And though all men should forsake Thee;
By Thy grace I'll follow Thee.
2\n
Though the road be rough and thorny,
Trackless as the foaming sea,
Thou hast trod this way before me,
And I'll gladly follow Thee.
3\n
Though I meet with tribulations, 
Sorely tempted though I be;
I remember Thou wast tempted,
And rejoice to follow Thee.
4\n
Though Thou leadest me through affliction,
Poor, forsaken though I be;
Thou wast destitute, afflicted,
And I only follow Thee.
5\n
Though to Jordan's rolling billows,
Cold and deep, Thou leadest me,
Thou hast crossed the waves before me,
And I still will follow Thee.
624  I Want Jesus to Walk With Me+

When the shades of life are falling,
I want Jesus to walk with me.

In my sorrows, Lord, walk with me.
When my heart within is aching,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
626  In a Little While We're Going Home+
1\n
Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way,
In a little while we're going home;
For the night will end in the everlasting day,
In a little while we're going home.
Refrain\n
In a little while, In a little while,
We shall cross the billow's foam;
We shall meet at last, When the stormy winds are past,
In a little while we're going home. 
2\n
We will do the work that our hands may find to do,
In a little while we're going home;
And the grace of God will our daily strength renew,
In a little while we're going home.
3\n
We will smooth the path for some weary, way-worn feet,
In a little while we're going home;
And may loving hearts spread around an influence sweet!
In a little while we're going home.
4\n
There's a rest beyond, there's relief from every care,
In a little while we're going home;
And no tears shall fall in that city bright and fair,
In a little while we're going home.
632  Until Then+
1\n
My heart can sing when I pause to remember,
A heartache here is but a stepping stone.
Along a trail, thats winding always upward,
this troubled world, is not my final home. 
Refrain\n
But until then, my heart will go on singing,
Until then, with joy I'll carry on,
Until the day my eyes behold the city,
Until the day God calls me home.
2\n
The things of earth will dim and loose there value,
If we recall they're borrowed for awhile;
And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,
Remember there, will only bring a smile.
645  God of our fathers+

Leads forth in beauty
all the starry band
Of shining world in

our hearts increase,
Thy bounteous goodness
nourish us in peace.

their toilsome way,
Lead us from night
to never-ending day;

To the name that brings salvation
Let the nations bow the head;
Let them kneel in adoration
When this name of names is said;
Let them pray for restoration
Of all things in Christ the head.

Rules in endless majesty;
May the kings of every nation
Now foreswear their enmity,
And with humble veneration
In the love of God agree.

Lord, we pray for upright rulers:
Guard them surely in their need
From the vanity of power 
And the emptiness of greed;
Let them see the truth of lowness,
And on justice let them feed.

Happy the home when God is there,
and love fills every breast;
when one their wish, and one their prayer,

is sweet to every ear;
where children early speak his fame,
and parents hold him dear.

Happy the home where prayer is heard,
and praise is wont to rise;

and all its wisdom prize.

this blessed peace to gain;

of tender charity and steadfast faith,
of patient hope and quiet, brave endurance,
with childlike trust that fears nor pain nor death.

grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife,
and to life's day the glorious unknown morrow
that dawns upon eternal love and life.
